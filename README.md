**[Announcement] Bevy Template in Development** ðŸš€

Iâ€™m working on this **Bevy template** and it will be regularly updated (until life gets too busy ðŸ˜…). The main goals of this template are **blazing performance** and **cross-platform support**. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s supported so far:

- **Mobile**: Some Android distributives (other Android distributives and iOS not tested yet)
- **Web**: Fully supported
- **Desktop**: Fully supported
  - **MacOS**: Both ARM and Intel-based  
  - **Linux**: Tested on Ubuntu, works perfectly  
  - **Windows**: All current builds (planning to test for older versions like Windows 8 soon)

This template is **modular, comprehensive, and universal**. The game is organized in **crates**, which makes it easy to customize and switch between 3D and 2D with minimal changes (e.g., adjusting player movement, world generation, etc.). 

Additionally, the template features a **debug menu** using **bevy-inspector-egui** and all components reflected to help with development and testing. The plan is to support as many targets as possible, including **Raspberry Pi**, **Steam Deck**, and other platforms.
