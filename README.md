> ## THE TEMPLATE IS IN FULL REWRITE! TERMINAL & STD FULL FEATURED 3D TEMPLATE! (`no-std` planned on further updates due to current Bevy no-std status)

Welcome to **LimitPush** ‚Äì a modular, high-performance cross-platform template for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/), designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind. This project is a work in progress but is rapidly evolving into a stable, feature-rich foundation for developing both 2D and 3D games in Bevy.

## Technologies

This project uses [`bevy`](https://bevyengine.org) as a **game framework** and its **community crates** by organizing everything in the **rusty** way. So, this project is written in Rust, with some script and web components for automatic updates/builds and [`wasm`](https://trunkrs.dev/) builds. Also, this project does graphs with automated scripts.

## üöÄ About the Project

**LimitPush** provides a universal template that accelerates development and facilitates easy extension, aiming to be the go-to framework for building Bevy-based games. Key features include:

- **Customizability**: Easily adjust core gameplay components such as player movement, object spawners, game mechanics, and more.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatibility across mobile, web, and desktop platforms (**terminal-based** OS **supported** too!), with ongoing efforts to expand further.
- **Future-Proofing**: Built with a vision for future platform support and optimized performance for a range of hardware setups.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

LimitPush comes packed with tools and features to streamline your development process:

- **Modular Architecture**: The game is structured with a **modular crate system**, offering flexibility to customize and extend as needed.
- **Platform Expansion**: Planning for future support on platforms such as **Raspberry Pi**, **Steam Deck**, and more. If you want a platform to be supported, feel free to open an issue!
- **Cross-Platform Performance**: Designed to provide high-performance gameplay on multiple platforms, ensuring smooth experiences whether you're developing for mobile, desktop, web, or embedded (yes, it supports embedded targets too).
- **Maximum Productivity**: Comes with various tools, preconfigured VSCode, extensions recommendations, bevy basic snippets and more!
