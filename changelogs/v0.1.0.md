# v0.0.1 -> 0.1.0

## A lot of changes
In the `v0.1.0` version I have made a lot of work, especially for movement, physics, scripts, graphs, inter-dependencies fix, reducing the amount of unwanted dependencies on specific targets, a lot (I mean, A LOT) of testing.

## Missing things?
Well, in this `minor` update, I've added a lot of features, but a lot of small bugs occured, that I don't really understand (the problem of that is the lack of deep understanding of some crates, like trunk, which compiles everything regardless the lib.rs conditional compilation, it required a lot of debugging to find that out)

These bugs will be fixed in `v0.1.1` patch update, by introducing these decisions/implementations:
- add a wasm native directory with a dedicated Cargo.toml without uncompatible to wasm family **internal crates**, such as `crates/debug` and `window_manager`,
- fix ui conflicting with virtual_joystick implementation,
- reduce the number of dependencies, even these of bevy,
- add some required features to bevy (I've reduced its features too hard :(",
- start deep testing on other Linux distributives,
- check out the bevy features, how do they affect cross-platform support and add platform-specific features,
- fix the actions script to fix the windows installer in release flow (fix the issue of windows build),
- others fixes
