# v0.1.0 -> v2.0.0-2.1.0

The version jump from `v0.1.0` to `v2.1.0` reflects significant changes and improvements. Many parts of the project were unstable before, so this jump marks a new, more refined version.

---

## Major Updates in v2.1.0

This version focuses heavily on **cross-platform compatibility** and **ergonomics** for developers.

### New Features

1. **`cross_setup` Crate**  
   - A new crate included in the project (for now).  
   - It simplifies setting up cross-platform features and configurations.

2. **`dep_reexp` Crate**  
   - Re-exports other crates with specific features to manage cross-platform requirements.  
   - This reduces clutter in the main `Cargo.toml` file, which was overloaded with configurations.

3. **Additional Crates**  
   - All other crates integrated into the project to provide distinct functionality (and enhance readability throughout the project).

4. **Considerable Web Enhancement**
   - Enhanced web page from [`bevy_game_template`](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template)
   - Smooth transition from the launching container to the gaming container
   - Animated spinner (author: [Niklas Eicker](https://github.com/NiklasEi))

### Current Limitations and Planned Solutions

Some challenges remain with the cross-platform structure. Here’s how they’ll be addressed:

1. **Feature and Platform Abstraction**  
   - Add platform-independent functions for tasks like spawning components (e.g., cameras).

2. **`dep_reexp` Ergonomics**  
   - Make the re-exporter crate more user-friendly.  
   - For example, developers should be able to write `use bevy::prelude::*` without worrying about pre-declaring crates like `bevy_ecs`.

3. **Cross-Platform Handler Library**  
   - A planned library to handle native operations (e.g., creating parallel processes, accessing the camera, or running background services).  
   - Focused on desktop platforms (embedded support will be minimal; partial support for WebAssembly).  
   - This library will be a core feature of LimitPush.

4. **OpenXR Support**  
   - `cross_setup` will manage platform-specific details for OpenXR.  
   - Developers must define some behavior for proper support.

5. **Input Abstraction Library**  
   - A library to map all native inputs into a unified structure.  
   - Supports compile-time and runtime input mapping.  
   - Will depend on `bevy` and other crates.

6. **Networking Library: `NetworkBroker`**  
   - A work-in-progress library to make network applications more efficient and ergonomic.  
   - Aims to transform how networking is handled in `bevy` and beyond.

7. **Launching Screen**  
   - Adds a pre-game **launching screen** (different from the loading screen).  
   - Prepares only the game’s essential components, while the loading screen handles the game itself.

8. **`cross_setup` as a Standalone Crate**  
   - While still part of the project, it will eventually be separated once it's tested and scaled for larger applications.

### Showcases

Two showcases will demonstrate LimitPush’s capabilities:

1. **Bevy-Based Text Editor**  
   - Runs on UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).  
   - Features file save/load, syntax highlighting, and ergonomic input/output.

2. **Cross-Platform 3D Game**  
   - Built with OpenXR support first, then adapted for other platforms.  
   - No embedded platform support is planned.
