# Credits

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to the following projects and people that inspired and contributed to the creation of **LimitPush**:

### Other Templates

- **[Bevy Game Template](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template)**  
  A huge thank you to the creators of this cross-platform template, whose work provided the foundational idea for **LimitPush**. Their approach to modular game development (with their mobile crate to build for Android and iOS) inspired much of my template structure.

- **[Bevy New 2D](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d)**  
  I deeply appreciate the design goals and organization of **Bevy New 2D**. Their clean structure was a significant influence on how I approached building a maintainable, scalable template for both 2D and 3D games.

## Special Thanks

I also want to extend a special thanks to the Bevy community and all contributors whose work continues to push the boundaries of what the Bevy engine can do. Your knowledge, feedback, and enthusiasm make this project possible. [**bushRAT**](https://github.com/bushrat011899), [**Niashi**](https://github.com/Niashi24), thank you for the insights and work on bevy no-std you've done so far!
