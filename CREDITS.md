# Credits

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to the following projects and people who inspired and contributed to the creation of **LimitPush**:

### Other Templates

- **[Bevy Game Template](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template)**  
  A huge thank you to the creator of this cross-platform template, whose work provided the foundational idea (and code!) for **LimitPush**. His approach to modular game development (with his mobile crate to build for Android and iOS) inspired much of my template structure. I have even written a special thanks below, especially for this developer!

- **[Bevy New 2D](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_new_2d)**  
  I deeply appreciate the design goals and organization of **Bevy New 2D**. Their clean structure was a significant influence on how I approached building a maintainable, scalable template for both 2D and 3D games.

## Special Thanks

I also want to extend a special thanks to the Bevy community and all contributors whose work continues to push the boundaries of what the Bevy engine can do. Your knowledge, feedback, and enthusiasm make this project possible. [**bushRAT**](https://github.com/bushrat011899), [**Niashi**](https://github.com/Niashi24), thank you for the insights and work you've done so far on **bevy no-std**!

The invaluable work of Niklas Eicker continues to guide me even today. My project has derived from his [bevy_game_template](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template), and I still use his code in the mobile and web (until v2.1.0) areas, as well as for CIs. I may have forgotten other aspects of his repository that I still rely on! Until the day I master the seven main targets (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, MacOS, WASM, OpenXR), I will continue to use his work as a model.
