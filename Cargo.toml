#   in all crates' Cargo.toml that need this feature to avoid the case
#   when a user just copies/pastes the whole crate into his project and
#   gets an unfixable error because of a missing feature (even if the
#   rust compiler should keep you aware from missing feature, sometimes
#   it can not happen..)
